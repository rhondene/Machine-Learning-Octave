# Machine-Learning-Journey Genesis:
Matlab/Octave implementation of supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms I learnt from 
the online course Machine Learning taught by the AI savant Dr.Andrew Ng. 

This course is my first encounter with machine learning and consistent programming some 2 years ago. I struggled through this course in the beginning but now I am proud to say my machine learning skills have grown tremendously since then, and now I can comfortably implement deep learning models. I recommend this course for anyone who wants to break into machine learning modelling.
