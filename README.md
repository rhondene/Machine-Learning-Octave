# Machine-Learning-Journey Begins:
Matlab/Octave implementation of supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms I learnt from 
the online course Machine Learning taught by the machine learning savant Dr.Andrew Ng. 

This course is my first encounter with machine learning and consistent programming. This course was struggle for me but now
I am proud to say my machine learning skills have grown tremendously since then and now I'm implementing deep learning models.
