<b> Model Selection: Train/Cross/Test Validation  and Learning Curves </b>

Contains code for adressing the high-variance - high bias problem so that the learning algorithm balances between fitting the dataset and being sufficiently generalisable to fit new data.
Learning curves will be used to visualie the effect of altering the number of features and size of regularisation factor (lambda) by comparing the training error and cross validation error.
