<b> Artificial Neural Network for Multiclass Classification  </b>
Implementation of ANN using logistic regression, with regularisation, as the activation fucntion to learn hand-written digits. More specifically these are the code I implemented as not all the code are mine
1. Foward Propagation to compute the output layer
2. Backpropagation to compute the gradient of the cost function required for advanced optimisation 
3. Two-sided Gradient checking
