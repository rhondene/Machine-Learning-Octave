<b> Artificial Neural Network for Multiclass Classification  </b>
Implementation of ANN using logistic regression, with regularisation, as the activation fucntion to learn hand-written digits. More specifically this includes:
1. Foward Propagation to compute the output layer
2. Backpropagation to compute the gradient of the cost function required for advanced optimisation 
3. Two-sided Gradient checking
4. Prediction
